0,Smooth and Professional,"
The iPhone 15 Pro Max is a really great phone. It has a beautiful screen, a powerful processor, and a fantastic camera. It lasts a long time on a single charge. If you want the best phone out there, this is it.

Recently, I updated to the latest version of 17.5.1 added emojis something like that and after that my device touch screen isn't responding now. And when I used the phone earlier, the device gets too warm easily when I started to play games...and I contacted the Amazon and iOS support and told me to visit the service centre and the service centre is like 1-2 days far from my home location. This isn't something I expected. The phone is very expensive and I bought recently, just in 1-2 months the device isn't usable, it need to be trash now smh...The device isn't even charging now..

5,Just amazing!,"
Just amazing product. Actually I like to purchase online products but as it's so expensive, I tried to purchase from local store in Barasat but they told me 8 thousand more than online price (Only phone's price)üòÄ even without charger, screen protector and back cover.I got it on online with everything only ‚Çπ1,52,000. Although it was a little difficult to buy, as you know it is not easy to transfer the higher amounts within short time. üòÄHowever, Thanks to Amazon team and specially thanks to my IDOL ""Steve Jobs"" üôèü§ó

7,Incremental Upgrade with Enhanced Camera,"
I recently upgraded to the Apple 15 Pro Max, and while the enhanced camera is undoubtedly impressive, but I feel that it falls short of delivering a truly groundbreaking experience. If you're already using the 13 pro or 14 Pro, there seems to be little incentive to make the leap.The camera improvements are noteworthy, capturing detail and clarity like never before. However, beyond this feature, the 15 Pro Max doesn't offer a significant leap in terms of innovation. Personally, I find the Pro versions more manageable in hand, and the Max variant, although boasting a larger screen, can be a bit unwieldy.In essence, the 15 Pro Max is a solid device with a stellar camera, but for those already enjoying the perks of the previous Pro models, the upgrade might not feel as compelling.
